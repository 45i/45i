# WhoAmI?
I am a developer at SpearFall Games and I LOVE to code.
Unlike other fellow earthlings, I do not like sports or games, instead I like to spend my free time reading books or programming.
I have been working on a project that is a FastSearcher.
The code is public and you can obviously check it out.
Like many, I enjoy the Great Literatures ie. Memes
